# ChoreoPRISM: Probabilistic System Modeling Repository

Welcome to the ChoreoPRISM repository! This repository hosts a unified framework for modeling and analyzing concurrent probabilistic systems. 


## Abstract

This framework introduces a simpler semantics for PRISM, enhancing its usability. Additionally, it defines a choreographic language with syntax and semantics tailored for intuitive modeling. The repository establishes the correctness of a projection function translating choreographic models to PRISM-compatible formats. Finally, it provides a compiler enabling seamless translation of choreographic models to PRISM, facilitating powerful analysis while maintaining expressive clarity. These contributions bridge the gap between high-level modeling and robust analysis in probabilistic systems.


## Usage

To use this framework, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/adeleveschetti/ChoreoPRISM.git

2. Navigate to the repository directory: cd ChoreoPRISM/src/

3. Execute the code by running the `Main.java` file: java Main.java

4. The generated PRISM code will be available in the `generated-sources` folder.
